        <ol>
            <li>Pellet 1–5 ml bacterial culture (not to exceed 15 OD units) by centrifugation for 30 seconds. Discard supernatant.
                <br>
                <br>
                <i>Note: For optimal performance, be sure to harvest cells at log phase (12-16 hours after inoculation). For a standard miniprep of a
                high copy plasmid to prepare DNA for restriction digestion or PCR, we recommend 1.5 ml of culture. For low copy plasmids, more
                culture can be used, but it is important not to process more than 15 OD units per prep/column.</i></li>
                <br>
            <li>Resuspend pellet in 200 μl Plasmid Resuspension Buffer (B1) (pink). Vortex or pipet to ensure cells are completely resuspended.
                There should be no visible clumps.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Lyse cells by adding 200 μl Plasmid Lysis Buffer (B2) (blue/green). Invert tube immediately and gently 5–6 times until color
                changes to dark pink and the solution is clear and viscous. Do not vortex! Incubate for one minute.
                <br>
                <br>
                <i>Note: Care should be taken not to handle the sample roughly and risk shearing chromosomal DNA, which will co-purify as a
                contaminant. Avoid incubating longer than one minute to prevent irreversible plasmid denaturation. </i></li>
                <br>
            <li>Neutralize the lysate by adding 400 μl of Plasmid Neutralization Buffer (B3) (yellow). Gently invert tube until color is uniformly
                yellow and a precipitate forms. Do not vortex! Incubate for 2 minutes.
                <br>
                <br>
                <i>Be careful not to shear chromosomal DNA by vortexing or vigorous shaking. Gently inverting the tube promotes good mixing,
                important for full neutralization.</i></li>
                <br>
            <li>Clarify the lysate by spinning for 2–5 minutes at 16,000 x g.
                <br>
                <br>
                <i>Note: Spin time should not be less than 2 minutes. Careful handling of the tube will ensure no debris is transferred and the 2 minute
                recommended spin can be successfully employed to save valuable time. For best results, and especially when using culture volumes
                > 1 ml, we recommend a 5 minute spin to ensure efficient RNA removal by RNase A. Also, longer spin times will result in a more
                compact pellet that lower the risk of clogging the column.</i></li>
                <br>
            <li>Carefully transfer supernatant to the spin column and centrifuge for 1 minute. Discard flow-through.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Re-insert column in the collection tube and add 200 μl of Plasmid Wash Buffer 1. Plasmid Wash Buffer 1 removes RNA, protein and
                endotoxin. (Add a 5 minute incubation step before centrifugation if the DNA will be used in transfection.) Centrifuge for 1 minute.
                Discarding the flow-through is optional.
                <br>
                <br>
                <i>Note: The collection tube is designed to hold 800 μl of flow-through fluid and still allow the tip of the column to be safely above the top
                of the liquid. Empty the tube whenever necessary to ensure the column tip and flow-through do not make contact.</i> </li>
            <li>Add 400 μl of Plasmid Wash Buffer 2 and centrifuge for 1 minute. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Transfer column to a clean 1.5 ml microfuge tube. Use care to ensure that the tip of the column has not come into contact with the flowthrough.
                 If there is any doubt, re-spin the column for 1 minute before inserting it into the clean microfuge tube. </li>
                 <br>
            <li>Add ≥ 30 μl DNA Elution Buffer to the center of the matrix. Wait for 1 minute, then spin for 1 minute to elute DNA.
                <br>
                <br>
                <i>Note: Nuclease-free water (pH 7–8.5) can also be used to elute the DNA. Delivery of the Monarch DNA Elution Buffer should be made
                directly to the center of the column to ensure the matrix is completely covered for maximal efficiency of elution. Additionally, yield may
                slightly increase if a larger volume of DNA Elution Buffer is used, but the DNA will be less concentrated as a result of dilution. For
                larger plasmids (≥ 10 kb), heating the DNA Elution Buffer to 50°C prior to eluting and extending the incubation time after buffer
                addition to 5 minutes can improve yield.</i> </li>
        </ol>
